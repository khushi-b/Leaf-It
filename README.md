## What is _Leaf-It_?
_Leaf-It_ is an automatic plant robot that will water your plant when dehydrated, send you reminders when the water resource is running low, and will also talk to your plant to keep them happy! _Leaf-It_ runs on a Raspberry Pi, detecting moisture levels of the soil through sensors and powers a DC motor water pump when levels are low. Using the Leaf-It website, users can sign up and select the plant they own to keep track of how their plant is doing. A user can also upload positive audio messages to the website that will talk to the plant while the user is away. This keeps the plant happy, and allows the user to go about their life not worrying about the wellbeing and health of their plant.
